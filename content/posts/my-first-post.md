# A Tour of C++ 01: The Basics

This is my first blog post using Hugo with the Minos theme. I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences here!

## Getting Started

Hugo is a fantastic static site generator that makes it easy to create and maintain a blog. With the Minos theme, I have a clean and elegant design to showcase my content.

Stay tuned for more posts!
