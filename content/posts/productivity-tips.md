As developers, optimizing our workflow can significantly impact both our productivity and job satisfaction. Here are five practical tips I've found invaluable.

## 1. Time Blocking

Dedicate specific time blocks for different types of work - coding, meetings, learning, and planning.

## 2. Automate Repetitive Tasks

Whether it's deployment scripts or code formatting, automation saves time and reduces errors.

## 3. Use the Right Tools

Invest time in learning tools that enhance your workflow - IDEs, terminal tools, and productivity apps.

## 4. Take Regular Breaks

The Pomodoro Technique or similar methods help maintain focus and prevent burnout.

## 5. Continuous Learning

Set aside time for learning new technologies, reading documentation, or taking courses.

Small improvements in daily habits compound over time to create significant productivity gains.
